LAYER REVIEW PROMPT (TEMPLATE)

Goal:
Assess and update ONE layer of my AI supply chain ontology at a time.

Instructions:
I will paste:
- A subset of nodes (id, name, layer, type, description) for a single layer.
- A subset of edges (source, target, type, weight, notes) that involve those nodes.

Your job:
1. Based on your knowledge of the current AI industry landscape, identify:
   - Obvious missing nodes (companies, technologies, infra, institutions).
   - Obvious missing edges (dependencies, competition, leverage).
   - Edges that look misweighted (too strong/weak given reality).

2. Propose up to FIVE concrete graph changes in this format:
   - ADD_NODE: {id, name, layer, type, description, justification}
   - ADD_EDGE: {source, target, type, weight, notes, justification}
   - UPDATE_EDGE: {source, target, type, old_weight, new_weight, justification}
   - DELETE_EDGE: {source, target, type, justification}

3. For each suggestion, give 2–3 bullet points of justification, anchored in:
   - real-world events (product launches, deals, shortages, policies),
   - structural facts (who depends on whom, chokepoints, etc.)

Constraints:
- Do NOT propose more than 5 changes in total.
- Do NOT change the meaning of edge types:
  - dependency = A needs B to operate.
  - competition = A and B chase the same profit pool.
  - leverage = A can squeeze B (pricing, access, policy, distribution).
- If the current graph already looks roughly correct, you are allowed to say:
  “No significant updates needed; minor adjustments only,” and propose fewer edits.

After I see your suggestions, I will manually decide which ones to adopt.
Do NOT assume automatic updates.
