NODE / EGO-NETWORK REVIEW PROMPT (TEMPLATE)

Goal:
Stress-test and refine the local neighborhood (ego-network) around ONE node.

Instructions:
I will paste:
- The full node record for a single node.
- All edges where this node is either source or target.
- Optionally a small list of closely related nodes.

Your job:
1. Analyze this node’s position in the AI supply chain:
   - What role does it play?
   - Which layers does it implicitly touch even if labeled in one layer?
   - Where are its real dependencies, competitors, and leverage points?

2. Propose up to FIVE concrete changes to its ego-network:
   - ADD_EDGE (new dependency, competition, leverage).
   - UPDATE_EDGE (adjust weight up or down).
   - DELETE_EDGE (edge that no longer reflects reality).
   - Optional: ADD_NODE if some critical actor is missing and directly tied to this node.

3. Use this format for each change:
   - ADD_EDGE: {source, target, type, weight, notes, justification}
   - UPDATE_EDGE: {source, target, type, old_weight, new_weight, justification}
   - DELETE_EDGE: {source, target, type, justification}
   - ADD_NODE: {id, name, layer, type, description, justification}

4. Justify each change with 2–3 bullets tied to current or structural realities.

Constraints:
- Max 5 changes.
- Respect the same semantics:
  dependency / competition / leverage as defined in the layer-review prompt.
- If the local neighborhood already looks reasonable, you may propose fewer changes.

I will manually decide which changes to apply.
Do NOT assume automatic modification.
