SCENARIO / HYPOTHETICAL REVIEW PROMPT (TEMPLATE)

Goal:
Use the ontology as a scaffold to explore “what if” scenarios,
WITHOUT directly editing the core graph.

Instructions:
I will paste:
- A short description of a hypothetical or future scenario.
- The relevant subset of nodes and edges from the ontology (for 1–3 layers).

Your job:
1. Describe, in plain language, how this scenario would likely impact:
   - dependencies,
   - competition,
   - leverage
   across the affected nodes and layers.

2. THEN, propose a set of TEMPORARY graph edits that would represent this world,
using the same change format as before:
   - ADD_NODE, ADD_EDGE, UPDATE_EDGE, DELETE_EDGE

3. Clearly mark these as “scenario-only” suggestions, so they are not confused with baseline reality.

4. Provide:
   - A short list of “winners” and “losers” in the scenario.
   - Any emerging chokepoints or new leverage points.

Constraints:
- Do NOT assume these changes are applied to the main ontology.
- Focus on clarity and structural reasoning, not on producing many edits.
- 3–7 suggested changes is enough for a scenario view.

I will decide manually whether any of these scenario insights should feed back into the core graph.
